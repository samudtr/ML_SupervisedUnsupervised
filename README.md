# Data Mining/ML Projects

These projects showcase my skills on data preprocessing, feature engineering + selection and model training. 

Used **Pandas** for data manipulation and **ScikitLearn** for model training and evaluation on **Supervised and Unsupervised** learning problems.

## Supervised Learning: 

Applied several advanced machine learning preprocessing and model training techniques to participate on a Kaggle competition. Granted 2nd place.

- Data exploration/understading
- Kurtosis/Skewness study to evaluate data distribution
- KNN Imputer used to handle missing values
- DBScan implemented to filter outliers
- Data rescaling and normalization (Yeo-Johson Transformation)
- Feature Selection using ML algorithms
- **Using GridSearchCV, found the best model among Lasso Regression, One-vs-Rest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Neural Network (MLPC)**. 


## Unsupervised Learning: 

Applied a two perspectives clustering solution to segment a dataset of a fictitious company. *Implemented K-Means and Hierarchical* clustering techniques.Â´


The final product is a two-layered cluster with sociodemographic and preferences plot.

- Several data exploration techniques used
- Z-score normalization,
- Outlier removal using DBScan
- K-Distance graph to find optimal number of clusters + Dendrogram
- Merge clusters using hierarquical technique
